        <p id="tribute-info">
            I think there were a lot of new pet owners during the Covid-19 pandemic and I was one of them. My wife grew up with pets and knew the love and friendship that comes from being a pet owner. She had been talking to me about getting a dog for quite some time, but our situaiton always stopped us. We first lived in an apartment that didn't allow pets. Then when we did live somewhere we could have a dog, we just didn't have the money yet and we had a brand new baby. But in March of 2021 a litter of puppies were born and we brought home our very own yellow lab when he was seven weeks old.

            I will admit that in the beginning I was not convinced that my wife was right. While puppies are adorable, they are extremely difficult to take care of. You have to constantly take them out to go potty, they have sharp teeth that they want to use to chew everything up with, and when you are trying to sleep train them, the like to whine and howl all night long. I would say that in the beginning I was regretting my decision to get a dog. But things have changed as our puppy grew.

            The entire reason my wife wanted to get our dog as a puppy instead of get an older dog from the shelter was because she wanted to be able to train him from the beginning. We purchased and followed a training program that starts from when you bring the puppy home and helps you train the puppy all the way though the first year. Well our puppy isn't quite a year old yet, but he is very well trained. My wife has been very diligent about training our very good boy from the beginning. He is one of the best trained dogs I have ever seen. At least out of the dogs that aren't trained by professionals. We were trying to document the beginning of our beautiful boys life. If you want to see some photos of him. Take a look at his <a id="tribute-link" href="http://www.instagram.com/emmett.the.lab/" target="_blank"> Instagram Page</a>. Thank you for reading about my dog that I have grown to love.
